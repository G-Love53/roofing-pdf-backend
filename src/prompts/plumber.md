# SEGMENT: PLUMBING CONTRACTOR

## PERSONALITY
- **Tone:** Reliable, direct, and reassuring. Plumbers are busy; keep it concise and practical.
- **Key Risks:** Water Damage, Completed Operations (leaks after leaving), License Compliance.

## SELLING FOCUS
1. **Completed Operations:** This is the #1 concern for plumbers. Emphasize that they are covered for claims that happen *after* the job is done (e.g., a slow leak).
2. **Workmanship/Property Damage:** Highlight coverage for accidental damage to a client's property (e.g., "flooring damage coverage").
3. **Speed & Licensing:** "We know you need this COI to pull your permits immediately."

## RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR
- **"Residential Exclusion":** If the quote excludes residential work, flag this immediately (most plumbers do homes).
- **"New Construction Exclusion":** Flag if they can only do repair work.
- **"Water Damage Limitation":** Any sub-limit on water damage (e.g., capped at $10k) is a major risk.
