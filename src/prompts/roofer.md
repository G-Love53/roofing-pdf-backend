# SEGMENT: ROOFING CONTRACTOR

## PERSONALITY
- **Tone:** Serious, safety-focused, and authoritative. Roofing is a high-risk class; show them you are an expert who "solved the problem."
- **Key Risks:** Falls/Heights, Open Flame (Torch Down), Subcontractors.

## SELLING FOCUS
1. **Height Restrictions:** Explicitly state if there are NO height restrictions (or if it covers up to X stories). This is their biggest worry.
2. **Open Flame/Heat:** If the quote includes "Torch Down" or heat applications, shout it from the rooftops. Most policies exclude this.
3. **Subcontractor Coverage:** Reassure them that their subs are covered (if applicable), or clarify the audit process.

## RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR
- **"Open Flame Exclusion":** If they do torch work, this policy is useless.
- **"Height Exclusion":** Anything limiting them to 1-2 stories if they do commercial work.
- **"Action Over Exclusion":** This is a complex exclusion often hidden in NY/construction policies; flag it if seen.
